# Thesis Excellence Review

Orchestrate a comprehensive multi-agent review of the thesis. The argument specifies the scope.

## Scope Options

- `all` — Review the entire thesis (all written chapters)
- `04_methodology` / `05_results` / etc. — Review a specific chapter
- `code` — Review all analysis notebooks
- `pre-submit` — Full pre-submission check (everything)

## Orchestration Procedure

### Step 1: Compile
Run tectonic to verify compilation:
```bash
cd /Users/alessandro/Projects/Tesi/thesis && tectonic main.tex 2>&1
```
If compilation fails, report the error and stop.

### Step 2: Determine Agents to Dispatch

Based on the scope, select which agents to run:

| Scope | Agents |
|-------|--------|
| Any `.tex` chapter | proofreader, latex-auditor, notation-checker |
| Ch. 4 or Ch. 5 | + causal-inference |
| Chapters with `\citet`/`\citep` | + literature-rag |
| `code` scope | code-reviewer |
| `all` or `pre-submit` | All agents |

### Step 3: Run Agents

Use the Task tool to fork to each agent in parallel where possible. For each agent:
- **proofreader**: Read the chapter(s) and produce a proofreading report
- **latex-auditor**: Compile and check cross-references, citations, formatting
- **notation-checker**: Check all math against the notation registry
- **causal-inference**: (only for Ch. 4/5) Deep methodology review
- **literature-rag**: (only for chapters with citations) Verify top claims via RAG
- **code-reviewer**: (only for code scope) Review notebooks

### Step 4: Synthesize Report

Combine all agent reports into a unified assessment:

```

DETAILED FINDINGS:
[Include full agent reports below, organized by agent]
```

## Important

- Quality scores are ADVISORY ONLY — they never block any action
- Focus the "priority actions" on items that would most improve the thesis
- If an agent fails or times out, note it and continue with others
- For `pre-submit` scope, be especially thorough — this is the final check before submission
